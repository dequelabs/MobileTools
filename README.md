# MobileToolsaxe Mobile tools to demonstrate REST API's from python---This project provies a python wrapper to the axe DevTools Mobile server REST API.It provides routines to perform the following operaitons:1. Authenticate with the server1. Retrieve scan data from the result key1. Set tags for a scan base don teh result keyAuthenticaion information is stored in the file mobiletest.yaml and a prototypefile is provided in mobiletest.master.yaml, included in this package.The current version requires username, password and a client secret to authentication.Future versions of the server will remove the client secret requirement.#Endpoints##MobileAdmin classThe constructor to the class takes the following arguments.auth_server_url - default value provided in mobiletest.master.yaml.server_url - default value provided in mobiletest.master.yaml.username - your username for the server.password - your password for the server.realm_name - default value provided in mobiletest.master.yaml.client_id - default value provided in mobiletest.master.yaml.client_secret_key - client secret provided to you**get_mobile_scan** - retrieve scan details from server*parameters:*-userid - keycloak user id for the user who owns the scan-package_name - package name of the scan being retrieved-resultid - result id key for the scan to retrieve*returns:*python dict with the details of the scan, including all passed and failedrules, the platform the scan was run against, the list of applied tags.**set_mobile_scan_tag** - set one or more tags for the scan identified with the input parameters*parameters:*-userid - keycloak user id for the user who owns the scan-package_name - package name of the scan being retrieved-resultid - result id key for the scan to retrieve-tag_list - python list of tag names to apply to the scan*returns:*python dict with the details of the scan, including all passed and failedrules, the platform the scan was run against, the list of applied tags.
